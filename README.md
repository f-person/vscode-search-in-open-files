a _smol🤏_ vs code extension that can activate the native search & prefill it with
open files, letting u find in all open files/tabs.

adds two commands to the command palette:

1. Search: Find in all Open Files
   - defualt keybinding: `cmd+shift+g` / `ctrl+shift+g`
2. Search: Find in Files of the Active Tab Group
   - default keybinding: none!
     - feel free to bind ur own to the `search-in-open-files.searchOpenFilesInActiveGroup` command!

🌠 give it a star on github if u feel like it:
